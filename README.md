ðŸ§ª Experiment 2: Study and Implementation of C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

ðŸ”¹ Aim:
To study and implement a C++ program demonstrating different data types by taking input from the user.


ðŸ”¹ Theory:
C++ provides built-in data types like:

int â€“ for integers

float â€“ for decimal numbers

double â€“ for large decimal values

char â€“ for single characters

bool â€“ for true/false values

string â€“ for a sequence of characters (text)

Using user input with these types helps understand input handling and type-specific behaviors.

ðŸ”¹Conclusion:
I successfully implemented a C++ program using different data types with user input, enhancing understanding of variable types and input/output operations.
