ðŸ§ª Experiment 2: C++ Program Structure and Data Types

ðŸ”¹ Aim

To study and implement a basic C++ program that demonstrates the use of different data types by accepting user input.


ðŸ”¹ Theory

C++ provides several built-in data types that are essential for variable declaration and data storage:


int â€“ Stores whole numbers

float â€“ Stores decimal numbers (single precision)

double â€“ Stores large decimal numbers (double precision)

char â€“ Stores single characters

bool â€“ Stores Boolean values (true or false)

string â€“ Stores text (sequence of characters)

By using input statements with these types, we can understand how C++ handles various kinds of data and how different types behave during input/output operations.

âœ… Conclusion

I implemented a simple C++ program that takes input for various data types, helping me understand how variables are declared, how input is taken from the user, and how data types affect program behavior. This experiment strengthened my foundational knowledge of C++ syntax and structure..
